So this is a brainwalk about the final page. For the book of many paths, the ceiling page. Big thing is that the name of the application has changed is no longer the book of many paths. It is the sage codex. So that change needs to be made throughout the documentation, that this is the sage codex. I also want to take a step back and make sure that we feel good about the stage names that we have. invoking a tuning, binding, weaving, inscribing, and ceiling. I know we talked about this in the context of like casting a spell. I want to make sure that that is what we're doing. You know, like, we're doing the right thing here. There's something about that that doesn't feel quite right in the sense of, um, adding a tail, to a book, to the Sage Codex. And so the Sage Codex is this. Yeah, let me just talk about more from just a minute and let's see what kind of things emerge. I'm just gonna brainwalk this. So I'm going to talk about kind of the naming, and then we'll go back to the actual page and what we want to accomplish there. Um, The Sage Codex is a collection of magical tales. And these tales were, in fact, conjured. Yeah, so this is good lore for like landing page kind of stuff. The Sage Codex contains Stories. crafted in this crafted with the collaboration of a sage and a human. So I think we can tell a whole story about what exactly is the nature of the stories in the sage codex? And so the stages are these you know, demigod kinds of guides, watchers, they represent, you know, like creative energy. But that creative energy gets translated into pages in the codex only in collaboration with a human. So I think we need to like run with that concept. There are these entities that have these tales to tell. And those tales are recorded in the sage codex. But they only come, they can only enter into our world and collaboration. with human storytellers. Well, that's really good. That is really good. So we need a whole thing about that. And so They're going, the human isn't like this collaborative process with a sage. I do note, I think, I think that part of what's going on here is that there needs to be, and this is probably like before the actual adventure is created. I think there needs to be like a stage selection. And for MVP, it can just be one sage, but we have Sullivan Torch. We have the other sage, whose name, I can't remember off the top of my head, probably means I need to change it. It's based on Matt Mercer. Um, So I think it's a very easy thing for us to Have multiple stages. To choose from. Whether that's from the jump or not. Um... Hey, no, I'm getting far afield here, but I do think, in terms of what this application is going to be, I think that... Well, a landing page... will have off, sign up. Users are gonna go to... You know what? I'm going on a rabbit trail there that I don't want to give energy to right now. Like, I want to get through all of these. Okay, I'll get back around. That'll be easy to cover. Okay. strike that from the record. So we had the stage codex, and we had this lower concept of what, you know, there's something going on here where this story's can, uh, be added to the stage codex. I think they're added to this H codex. I mean, I guess it's possible that they could. It's possible that the stories are already in the Sage Codex, and human collaboration brings them into the real world. That can be kind of fun. Yeah, I like that. The sage codex has, like, infinitely many stories. They can only be known to us. They know, the story, the stories of the stages. But the stories remain... locked away, kept, maybe sealed in the Sage Code accident is only when collaboration was human. that those are substantiated in the real world. See, I like this. Because that means that in the final stage we're not sealing, Um, we are... I don't know if we're conjuring, we're summoning. I don't know what we're doing, but we are bringing that tail into the real world. I do think we are... So then what would those stages be? I really like the names that we have, but I think it's a miss to talk about it in terms of spell casting. I could be wrong about this. But I think that what we're doing is We're co creating a story. Not a spell. Although the thing itself is, we are bringing forth magic. That is true. But I guess what I'm saying is I would like another run at what the titles of the stages are. Because they feel like an 80% fit. But it needs to be tighter. It needs to be like more like yes. And here, like currently it's like, oh, that's cool. I want to be... Oh, that's really cool. And also, 0 shit, yeah, that's types. Like, they were intentional about this. And I am not I'm not coming up with anything. So I would love your input. At the very least, I want to. You make it very clearly, the last stage is not the ceiling. Because the tale is now coming out of Codex. So, I don't know if that's, I don't know, maybe it's releasing. I don't believe. But let's talk about that page. And I'm gonna, kind of, what do you call it? I want to call it multiple things probably. The purpose of the page is to confirm with the user that everything is in place, everything's done. I want this to feel less like, hey, you want to change anything and more of look at what you've created. So it needs to feel more I think celebratory than it does. It's still pretty strong. It's more celebratory than it needs to seem. Like last check. In fact, At this point, there really isn't any changing things. with the possible exception of the name. So this really is a confirmation screen. Yeah, the purpose of this is a confirmation screen. And so really, Because of that being the purpose, 1st of all, all the user can do is like download their files. Currently, the screen shows that they have a choice. I don't think we give one choice. I think we give them a zip file. And it has marked down PDF and JSON all in it. Um, I don't actually, I don't think we give them JSON. I think we give them markdown and PDF. I think we give a case up. So downloading or clicking a button or whatever it is, ends up Downloading as a file. It also is going to save The chapter? Maybe we call it a chapter. I don't know. Call it an adventure. I'm not sure. But we're gonna save that to the user's account. inside this web app. That's not anything we need to show on the screen. Just noting it for system actions. documentation. Now is a good time to say this. When we finish this screen, we'll have all of them done. I want you to Go back through the stages, doc. I also want you to go into the brainwalks repost, so repost, forward slash framewalks. And there is a plan there that talks about, let's see what it's called. Brains and system actions? There are a lot of system action descriptions. in that brainwalk plan. Some of what is in that plane is outdated. Because I already sorted through a lot of it. So you have to use some discretion and judgment on knowing which system actions are still relevant, which aren't. You will know by comparing them to the HTML lockups. So, Whatever system action descriptions I have in that, need to be adapted to the current source of truth, which are those mockos. So if something doesn't make sense, given the mockups, mockups are right. So they kind of makes sense. But the mockup showed a little bit differently, adapted to the mockups. So you'd be reviewing stages dot in D and that frames and system actions plan and Rebo's 4 slash framewalks, 4 slash plans. And what I want is a, and this may already be happening in stages, but I feel like we need another document that's maybe a cleaner. Maybe not. I don't know. But we need a per page documentation of relevant system actions. I'm gonna take those documents and give them back to you as we actually turn these from mockups to actual code or function code. Um, And so whether that's just an updated stages doc, I feel like it needs to be its own standalone doc. even if it's, yeah, relatively similar to stages. Um, But I do want you to do that. That's really going to be the next thing after we finish off the final page. Okay. So the final page is a confirmation screen. The one and only one user action. is to download file for files, zip file. Um, And so really the panel needs to have needs to have a button. Um... It doesn't just need to say downloads a file. There probably needs to be some explanatory text above the button that says, When you, using current language, seal is spelled, The zip file, PDF and markdown documents would be saved to your computer and also those files we'd see. in your, um, stage codex account. The Jack content? Is really just, like, Hey, good job. Um, You can see all the details of Your adventure here, click and button it down in the bottles. And you know, to bring this story to life or something like that, something, something cool. And then the panel itself, is going to show The title? And maybe... So it's gonna show the title. And then I think it might show the spark. to show where the user started. And I think we can tie this into lore. So this is this is what your spark produced. There was the spark. And that's just a, you know, taking that back from the very 1st page. And... I don't think we do the thing about... Four scenes by NPCs that feels to, this takes me out of version. The pages it is right now, like checkmarks, it just takes me out of a version. This feels like I'm the ride is over. And I want this to be a C what we did together moment. So we're gonna have a title, we're gonna start with a spark. Under that. Um, Then I think we are going to have the inciting incident. which I would presume would be preserved. Um, and then I don't think we get through all 4 scenes. Yeah, I think we gotta go find him here. Because it's the binding page. Yeah, we're gonna do the title. We're gonna go Spark. We're not into the inciting incident. Or are we? Yeah, I think we're gonna do... Spark. And then from binding, we're going to do what amounts to the text for the like the frame overview. I don't know that we call it, overview, or maybe we do call it. We call it Spark. We call it the Um Frame? Then we call it the, I mean, we have that, like, explanatory text or distributive texts on the frame panel. And then I think we also have the inciting incident. So spark out of that. We have frame content for that. We have inciting incident content for that. Um... And then I think we have some commentary that simply says, Your... Adventure? Is ready? to be... released, ready to be summoned, ready to be unsealed. Uh, Sage has delivered the adventure to you. Something like that. It is now in your hands. Ah, yeah, there we go. Now there's a charge. So we got the spark, we got the frame, we got the inciting incident. We got the your adventure is now ready. It has been delivered to you by Sage. And just now. In your hands. to take this adventure from the pages of the Sage Codex. And let live. The on the pages of the stage codex and in the story at your table. Now, you and your table get to bring this story to life because this is not you've created this, right? So you've, you are now the carrier of this back to the table. has been delivered to you, but it doesn't really take root and flourish until... It is released at your table. And then I think there's like a, you know, go ghetto tiger. kind of message. I think that's it. And then you got the button at the bottom, and then you've got the Clicking this button, download it, add it to your account, without, yeah, something like that. Uh, We'll download your meter. And that's really the only point in which I can merge and breaks. And then, I don't know what the button says, though. Uh. Does it release the adventure, but it's not... It's... Is it unsealing the adventure? I don't know. I'm not sure. I'll need to look to you for some guidance on that, 'cause I'm not sure how we're gonna go with language. But that's kind of it. I don't think we do much more than that.
