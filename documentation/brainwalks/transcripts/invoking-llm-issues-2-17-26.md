On the sessions page, I see my previous sessions. A couple of things about that. One is that the stage has no padding between that and the adventure name. So test, which is a name, and invoking our button right up next to each other. Um, Second, the invoking It was way too small. Can't see it. So, I think the session name needs to be in the same font as past sessions. It also needs to be gold. And then invoking needs to be a larger font size and a brighter color. It's very dark. And. Maybe all caps. I don't think so, because I don't think we capitalize it anywhere else, but those changes need to be made. And then the biggest thing, though, is that when I click on a past session, it needs to return me to, um, a fresh whatever, whatever stage, it needs to take me back to wherever I left off and give me a fresh canvas for that stage.
