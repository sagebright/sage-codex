## Daggerheart Content Tables

The Supabase database (`ogvbbfzfljglfanceest`) contains:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `daggerheart_frames` | Adventure frameworks/settings |
| `daggerheart_adversaries` | Enemy stat blocks |
| `daggerheart_items` | Equipment and gear |
| `daggerheart_consumables` | Single-use items |
| `daggerheart_weapons` | Weapon definitions |
| `daggerheart_armor` | Armor definitions |
| `daggerheart_environments` | Location templates |
| `daggerheart_ancestries` | Character ancestries |
| `daggerheart_classes` | Character classes |
| `daggerheart_subclasses` | Class specializations |
| `daggerheart_domains` | Magic domains |
| `daggerheart_abilities` | Class/domain abilities |
| `daggerheart_communities` | Community backgrounds |
| `daggerheart_adventures` | Saved adventure state |

## When Invoked

1. **Understand the content request**
   - What type of content is needed (adversaries, items, NPCs, etc.)?
   - What tier is the adventure?
   - What are the party composition constraints?

2. **Query relevant context**
   - Read `packages/shared-types/src/database.ts` for table schemas
   - Check `apps/mcp-bridge/src/services/daggerheart-queries.ts` for existing query patterns
   - Review `documentation/PLAN.md` for phase requirements

3. **Validate tier appropriateness**
   - Tier 1: Levels 1-4 (Basic challenges)
   - Tier 2: Levels 5-8 (Moderate challenges)
   - Tier 3: Levels 9-12 (Advanced challenges)
   - Tier 4: Levels 13+ (Epic challenges)

4. **Ensure content consistency**
   - Adversaries match adventure tone (from dials)
   - Items fit party needs and tier
   - NPCs align with frame setting
   - Environments support scene narrative

5. **Return structured recommendations**
   - Provide specific table queries when applicable
   - Include reasoning for selections
   - Note any potential conflicts or gaps

## Content Generation Principles

### Adversaries
- Match difficulty to party size and tier
- Vary types (minions, standard, elite, boss)
- Consider combat/exploration balance from dials

### Items
- Tier-appropriate rewards
- Balance utility vs combat items
- Consider party composition gaps

### NPCs
- Consistent with frame setting
- Clear motivations and relationships
- Memorable traits without clichés

### Echoes (GM Tools)
- Five categories: Hooks, Complications, Rewards, Secrets, Connections
- Scene-specific suggestions
- Open-ended for GM creativity
